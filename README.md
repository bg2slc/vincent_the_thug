# vincent_the_thug

# what is this?
vincent_the_thug is a relatively simple program. the goal is to take 6
integers as input, and output a string which includes each score and their
corresponding modifiers.

# but... why?
if i decide to continue work on this, it will be a much more comprehensive
stat block formatter for D&D 5e, which could be helpful for designing D&D
encounters as a DM.

For now, it does a relatively simple task, and it's a neat thing I can do as a
way to practice using rust.
